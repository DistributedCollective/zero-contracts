     *
     * It simulates a redemption of `_ZUSDamount` to figure out where the redemption sequence will start and what state the final Trove
     * of the sequence will end up in.
     *
     * Returns three hints:
     *  - `firstRedemptionHint` is the address of the first Trove with ICR >= MCR (i.e. the first Trove that will be redeemed).
     *  - `partialRedemptionHintNICR` is the final nominal ICR of the last Trove of the sequence after being hit by partial redemption,
     *     or zero in case of no partial redemption.
     *  - `truncatedZUSDamount` is the maximum amount that can be redeemed out of the the provided `_ZUSDamount`. This can be lower than
     *    `_ZUSDamount` when redeeming the full amount would leave the last Trove of the redemption sequence with less net debt than the
     *    minimum allowed value (i.e. MIN_NET_DEBT).
     *
     * The number of Troves to consider for redemption can be capped by passing a non-zero value as `_maxIterations`, while passing zero
     * will leave it uncapped.
